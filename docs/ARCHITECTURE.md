# Architecture

## `core/`

Shared by every sub-app:

- `config.py`: layered config. Code defaults, overridden by a `sluice.yaml`
  file, overridden last by environment variables.
- `vault.py`: the lead/experience store. Reads and writes an Obsidian-style
  markdown vault without clobbering status, scores, or notes a human or
  another agent has already set: a fresh scrape touches only a `last_seen`
  marker on an existing note.
- `backends.py`: LLM clients. `ClaudeMaxBackend` shells out to a `claude`
  CLI, local or over SSH; `AnthropicBackend` calls the Anthropic Messages
  API directly; `OpenAiCompatibleBackend` calls any OpenAI-compatible HTTP
  endpoint; `FallbackBackend` tries the first and falls back to the second
  on error; `make_backend` builds any of them by name.
- `camofox.py`: an HTTP client for a Camofox headless-browser server, the
  impure fetch boundary that ingest sources drive a tab through.
- `status.py`: the canonical status vocabulary shared across sub-apps.
  Triage owns the early states (new, shortlist, research, needs_review,
  dismiss); track owns the later ones (applied, phone_screen, ... offer,
  rejected); neither overwrites the other's.
- `seendb.py`: a sqlite dedup store for already-seen leads.
- `resilience.py`: retry-with-backoff, hard timeout, and rate-limit
  precheck helpers that wrap each source's I/O.
- `health.py`, `dossier.py`, `leads.py`, `log.py`, `relevance.py`: health
  reporting, per-lead dossier assembly, the source-agnostic `Lead` model,
  logging, and the relevance gate.

## The five sub-apps

1. **ingest** (`sluice/ingest/`): declarative sources (`base.Source`, split
   into an impure `fetch` and a pure `parse`) driven by `engine.run()`,
   which dedups via `core.seendb`, gates via `core.relevance`, and writes
   through a sink (vault or JSON) to the lead store.
2. **triage** (`sluice/triage/`): `classify.py` resolves obvious cases
   deterministically, for free; only kept, ambiguous leads are enriched
   and sent to an LLM judge (`judge.py`, `prompt.py`, over `core.backends`).
   `apply.py` writes verdicts back, skipping any lead already in the
   application lifecycle; `audit.py` logs every decision.
3. **cv** (`sluice/cv/`): select verified source material, bundle it into
   a closed set, compose a tailored CV against that bundle (an LLM call
   over `core.backends`), validate it against a fabrication gate (a hard
   fail triggers exactly one retry, then the lead is skipped rather than
   rendered ungated), render (shells out to an external script), and serve
   under an opaque, cache-busted filename.
4. **apply** (`sluice/apply/`): select eligible leads, stage the rendered
   CV file and a prep packet, and record the applied transition
   (never-clobber). Actual ATS form submission is human-driven; this
   sub-app prepares the material, it does not drive a browser.
5. **track** (`sluice/track/`): fetch Gmail and Google Calendar since the
   last run, classify each message into an `Event` (refuse rather than
   guess on ambiguity), and reconcile it against lead status
   (never-regress: a status can only move forward).

## Adapter-selector seams

Four points in the config are the intended seams for pluggable adapters.
Today each one has exactly one implementation; there is no runtime selector
because there is nothing yet to select between.

- **backend**: `core/backends.py`, `cv.config.primary_backend` /
  `fallback_backend`, `track.config.claude_max_*`. Today: a Claude CLI
  shell-out (local or SSH) primary, a per-token HTTP backend as fallback.
  SP2 adds a direct LLM API backend.
- **store**: `core/vault.py`. Today: an Obsidian-style markdown vault on
  disk. SP4 adds a pluggable store interface.
- **renderer**: `cv/config.render_script`, `cv/render.py`. Today: shells
  out to an external WeasyPrint script the operator supplies. SP3 bundles
  a renderer so this is no longer an external dependency.
- **fetch**: `core/camofox.py`, `ingest/base.py` (`Source.fetch`). Today:
  a Camofox headless-browser HTTP server. SP5 adds a pluggable
  fetch/browser adapter.
